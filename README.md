# Conway's Game of Life
In 1970, John Horton Conway devised a cellular automaton that followed three rules:
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
